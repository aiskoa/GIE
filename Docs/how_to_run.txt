How to Run GIE (Go-based Information Encryptor)

This document provides instructions on how to run the GIE application in development mode and how to build and run the production executable on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Go:** Version 1.18 or higher. Download from https://golang.org/dl/
*   **Node.js:** LTS version. Download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
*   **Wails CLI:** Install using Go:
    ```bash
    go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest
    ```

## Running in Development Mode

Development mode provides hot-reloading for frontend changes, making it ideal for active development.

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd D:/Users/alexa/Documentos/VSC/GIE
    ```
2.  **Run the development command:**
    ```bash
    wails dev
    ```
    The application will open in a new window, and any changes saved in the `frontend/` directory will automatically refresh the UI.

## Building and Running the Production Executable

To create a standalone executable for distribution or deployment.

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd D:/Users/alexa/Documentos/VSC/GIE
    ```
2.  **Build the application for your target platform:**

    ### For Windows (Current OS)
    ```bash
    wails build -platform windows/amd64
    ```
    This will generate `gie.exe` in the `build/bin` directory.

    ### For Linux
    ```bash
    wails build -platform linux/amd64
    ```
    This will generate an executable (e.g., `gie`) in the `build/bin` directory.

    ### For macOS
    ```bash
    wails build -platform darwin/amd64
    ```
    This will generate a `.app` bundle (e.g., `gie.app`) in the `build/bin` directory.

3.  **Run the executable:**

    *   **Windows:** Navigate to `build/bin` and double-click `gie.exe`.
    *   **Linux:** Navigate to `build/bin` in your terminal and run `./gie`.
    *   **macOS:** Navigate to `build/bin` and double-click `gie.app`.

## File Association (for .gie files)

To open `.gie` files directly with the GIE application by double-clicking them, you need to set up file association on your operating system.

*   **Windows:**
    1.  Right-click on any `.gie` file.
    2.  Select "Open with" -> "Choose another app".
    3.  Click "More apps" -> "Look for another app on this PC".
    4.  Navigate to the `build/bin` directory of your GIE installation and select `gie.exe`.
    5.  Check the box "Always use this app to open .gie files" and click "OK".

*   **Linux:**
    File associations on Linux are typically managed through MIME types and `.desktop` files. The exact steps can vary depending on your desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE).
    Generally, you can right-click a `.gie` file, go to "Properties" or "Open With", and set the default application. For a more permanent system-wide association, you might need to create or modify a `.desktop` file for GIE and associate it with the `application/x-gie` MIME type (or similar).

*   **macOS:**
    1.  Right-click (or Ctrl-click) on any `.gie` file.
    2.  Select "Get Info".
    3.  In the "Open with:" section, select your GIE application (e.g., `gie.app`).
    4.  Click "Change All..." to apply this association to all `.gie` files.
